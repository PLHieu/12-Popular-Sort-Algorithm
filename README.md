# 12-Popular-Sort-Algorithm
This is a project about researching and implementing popular sort algorithms conducting in my course Data Structure and Algorithm
*** In my project, I have created a class for you to test, that class is called Sort

*** You can test how much time the algorithm runs by going to Main.cpp file and doing the following

Sort sort (Sort :: REVERSED, 30000, Sort :: SHELL); // Create a Sort object with size 30000, Reversed data, and use shell sort
sort.Sort_Count_exetime (); // Proceed to run the sort function

After the sort function runs, it will write the time to a file called time.txt in the same directory, if you want to use other types of sort, you can replace one of the three parameters above.

** In addition, I also insert the results of the summary of the algorithm time into the report file
